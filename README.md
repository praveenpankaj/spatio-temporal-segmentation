# üåç Spatio-Temporal Segmentation Performance Benchmarking

Spatio-temporal segmentation of satellite images for crop monitoring using Deep Learning and PASTIS dataset.

## About

This repository contains code and resources for performing spatio-temporal segmentation of satellite images, specifically for **crop monitoring**. The project uses **Deep Learning techniques** and the benchmark **PASTIS dataset** (https://github.com/VSainteuf/pastis-benchmark). A key contribution of this work, as presented at the 31st IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing, Data, and Analytics (HiPC) 2024, is the **investigation of Gaussian noise addition as augmentation to the images and the effect's on the model's accuracies**. The study involves **using different cloud computing infrastructure (Google T4 GPU and AWS g4dn.xlarge) but same architecture and analyzing the impact on segmentation performance.**  The project includes comparisons of the model's performance under these conditions. The goal is to identify and delineate agricultural fields and monitor their temporal evolution using satellite image time series, while also assessing the model's reliability in real-world scenarios with different computations. We use **U-TAE (U-Net with Temporal Attention Encoder)** as a model.

üõ∞Ô∏è **Key Findings:**
- **AWS g4dn.xlarge** consistently outperforms **Google Colab T4 GPU** in accuracy and IoU.
- **Gaussian noise augmentation** improves generalization and model robustness.
- Hardware configurations significantly affect segmentation performance.
